# Steam Game Recommender
Project which will search one's steam library and provide a recommendation for their next game.

## Development Tools
- Conda
  - Certain packages from Conda are planning to be used for the recommendation algorithm. `Hello.py` should be able to verify that your packages are working.
- Pylint
  - Pylint will be used to maintain styling and good practices throughout the code. `.pylingrc` is a tracked file and holds the config for this project.
- Mypy
  - From Mypy documentation: "Mypy is a static type checker for Python. Type checkers help ensure that youâ€™re using variables and functions in your code correctly. With mypy, add type hints (PEP 484) to your Python programs, and mypy will warn you when you use those types incorrectly."
